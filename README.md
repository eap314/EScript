QLang is a language that is built for simplicity and ease of use. It was mainly made for future compatability with quantum computers. QLang files should go by the extension ql.

This is raw source code. For a better download, download with the links below.

The QLang interpreter is built both branched and branchless. If you do not know the pros and cons of branchless programming, [download branched](https://craft1c.net/QLang/branched). If you do want the slight optimizations, at the cost of a longer time between updates, [download branchless](https://craft1c.net/QLang/branchless).
